description: Finish the current implementation plan — one chunk per pass, then the next, across turns until the plan is done. Use when the user says "run them all", "finish the plan", "run-implementation-plan-all", or starts /goal without naming a single chunk.

# Run an Implementation Plan — All

Finish the plan. This is the same loop as [`run-implementation-plan`](../run-implementation-plan/SKILL.md). Follow that skill in full — the queue, the twelve card steps, the definition of done, and the host continuation.

Host `/goal` starts this loop. The interval is next card, not a clock.

Verification follows `run-implementation-plan`: batch the smallest directly relevant test evidence when behavioural code warrants it, inspect diffs, and run `git diff --check`. Do not run TypeScript, lint, knip, UI, or full-suite gates during cards or close-out. Those belong to `ready-for-pr` only when the user explicitly asks for readiness or checks.

**Not this skill:** writing a plan (`author-implementation-plan`). A named chunk with **only** stops after that card, still via `run-implementation-plan`.
