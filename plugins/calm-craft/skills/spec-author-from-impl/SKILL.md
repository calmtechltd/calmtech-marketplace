description: Author a feature spec by working backwards from existing code and tests, capturing what the product actually does today including a user-flow contract for journeys that already exist. Use when the user says "spec this existing feature", "document how this works", "we need a spec for X that's already built", or when backfilling a spec estate on an existing codebase. Pairs with spec-author-greenfield for design-first authoring.

# Author a Spec From an Existing Implementation

Capture the observable behaviour of something already built. **You are excavating, not designing** — the spec must describe what the product does today, which is frequently not what anyone believed.

Format authority: [`references/spec-format.md`](../../references/spec-format.md).

## When to use

- Backfilling specs on an existing codebase.
- "Document how this actually works."
- Before a significant change to an under-understood feature.

**Not this skill:** specs for unbuilt features (`spec-author-greenfield`), checking an existing spec against code (`spec-audit-drift`), or redesigning the captured journey (`spec-storyboard-journey`).

## Workflow

### 1. Map the surface

Find every entry point: routes, handlers, mutations, queries, jobs, event consumers, UI screens. Read the tests — they encode intent nobody wrote down elsewhere. Note what's covered and what isn't; the gaps matter later.

### 2. Derive behaviours from what a user can observe

Work outward from entry points to user-visible outcomes. A behaviour is something someone using the product experiences — not a function that exists.

Translate as you go. "The handler returns 409 when the row has a non-null archived_at" becomes "Archiving something already archived tells the user it's already archived and changes nothing."

### 3. Badge honestly — this is the hard part

The temptation is to mark everything 🟢 implemented because the code exists. Resist it.

- 🟢 only where the behaviour is complete **and** tested.
- 🟡 where the code half-does it — the note on what's missing is the most valuable line in the spec.
- 🔵 for behaviour the code clearly anticipates but doesn't implement.

**An estate of honest badges tells you where the product actually is.** An estate of optimistic ones tells you nothing and costs the same to write.

### 4. Capture what you find along the way

Backfilling surfaces things. Record them rather than smoothing them over:

- Contradictions between two screens or paths → an Open Question, or two behaviours with a note.
- Rules nobody can justify → a behaviour plus an Open Question asking whether it's intended.
- Dead paths → Out of Scope, or flag them for deletion.

If the code does something you suspect is a bug, **write the behaviour as the code behaves** and raise an Open Question. Don't quietly spec the intended behaviour — that turns a spec into a wish and hides the bug.

### 5. Flow contract for journeys that exist

If the feature is a wizard, import, or approval, trace the real navigation from the code: every state, every transition, every guard, and — critically — the back, cancel, retry, and failure paths the implementation actually supports.

Write the YAML first, generate Mermaid from it. Where the code allows a transition that looks wrong, record it and raise an Open Question rather than omitting it. The contract must describe reality before it can constrain it.

If the user wants to improve the journey, hand the factual baseline to `spec-storyboard-journey`. Do not add target storyboard evidence while excavating current behaviour.

### 6. Hand back

Path; counts of behaviours by badge; invariants; flow transitions; Open Questions. Call out explicitly: anything you found that looks like a bug, and any behaviour you couldn't determine from the code.

## Quality gate

- [ ] Behaviours describe observable outcomes, not functions.
- [ ] Badges reflect tested reality, not the existence of code.
- [ ] Every 🟡 carries a note on what's missing.
- [ ] Contradictions and suspicious behaviour recorded, not smoothed.
- [ ] A flow contract matches what the code actually permits.
- [ ] No implementation language in behaviour text.

## Anti-patterns

- **Badging everything implemented.** The single most common failure, and it makes the estate worthless.
- **Speccing the intent instead of the behaviour.** Hides bugs behind a document that looks authoritative.
- **Transcribing the code.** "Calls `validateSchedule` then persists" is not a behaviour.
- **Omitting the ugly paths** from a flow because they look like mistakes. Record them and ask.

## Related skills

- `spec-audit-drift` — later, to check the spec still matches
- `spec-assess-coverage` — find which of these behaviours have tests
- `spec-triage-bug-report` — for the suspicious behaviour you found
- `spec-storyboard-journey` — improve the captured journey without rewriting its baseline
- `spec-gap-sweep` — track the backfill across the estate
